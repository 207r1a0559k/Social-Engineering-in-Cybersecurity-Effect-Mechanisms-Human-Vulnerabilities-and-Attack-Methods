Intruders gained access to its research on Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and emails and correspondences among DNC officials. Over the course of the presidential campaign, the threat actors released DNC correspondence through intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, revealing information about infighting among top party officials and leading to the resignation of the DNC chair. The threat actors also went after John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clintonâs campaign, and released more embarrassing data throughout the summer.

The secretary of homeland security and the director of national intelligence released a joint statement asserting that the protracted cyber espionage campaign was the work of Russian actors. The Barack Obama administration subsequently sanctioned Russian intelligence officials and deported suspected officers working in the United States. The DNC compromise is believed to be part of a larger Russian espionage campaign waged for the purpose of manipulating the electoral systems in Western democracies and undermining faith in the democratic process in the United States, France, Germany, and elsewhere.

In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted twelve officials of the Russian military intelligence agency, known as GRU, believed to have been responsible for this incident.

The comprehensive report detailed evidence connecting APT 1 and the PLA, offered insight into APT 1âs operational malware and methodologies, and provided timelines of the espionage it conducted.

FireEye termed Unit 61398 âAPT 1â to indicate that the threat actor was an Advanced Persistent Threat, a type of operation in which the goal of the network intrusion is not only to gain access to a server or system, but also to retain ongoing access and engage in protracted cyber operations.

At the time, the media reported that U.S. intelligence believed the denial of service was in response to U.S. imposed economic sanctions to counter Iranâs nuclear program. Seven Iranian individuals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were eventually indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2016 for their involvement in the incident.Â 

The denial of service attacks against U.S. banks is significant for two reasons. First, the size and scale of the attacks led the State Department to seek other countriesâ assistance in taking down the compromised computers that were flooding the banks with junk traffic.

Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon. Many experts and former government officials feared that the attack on Natanz would open the door to other states conducting destructive cyberattacks and Stuxnet would represent, in the words of former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, a moment when âsomebody crossed the Rubicon.â However, nation-states have so far exercised restraint.",Denouncement   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-stuxnet-idUSTRE73G0NB20110417,"Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, United States, Uzbekistan, Russia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan","Israel, United States",Vulnerabilities,Military,http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32stuxnet-network-information,2

Agent.btz,11/28/2008,Associated with Turla,"Agent.btz was malicious software designed to steal documents from classified and unclassified U.S. military networks in 2008. A flash drive infected with Agent.btz was reportedly inserted into a laptop at a U.S. military base in the Middle East, and from there the worm spread undetected to U.S. computers at the Department of Defense and in combat zones. Russia is suspected of being behind the incident. Once the compromise was detected, it took fourteen months to remove Agent.btz from the Pentagonâs networks and the incident triggered a departmental ban of USB drives.

Agent.btz was a significant breach of U.S. military systems, and the vulnerabilities it exposed ultimately led to the creation of U.S. Cyber Command, a military command with the mission of defending Department of Defense networks and conducting offensive cyber operations for the U.S. military.",,"United States, Russia, Spain, Italy, Kazakhstan, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Ukraine",Russian Federation,Espionage,"Military, Private sector",http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/28/nation/na-cyberattack28,0
